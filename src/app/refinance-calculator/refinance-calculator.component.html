    <h2>When Should You Refinance?</h2>
    <p>Refinancing can make sense when interest rates drop significantly, allowing you to lower your monthly payments or shorten your loan term. However, consider closing costs and how long you'll stay in the home.</p>
    <p>Our calculator helps you model different scenarios to determine if the savings from a lower rate outweigh the costs of refinancing.</p>
