    <h2>How Extra Payments Work on Your Mortgage</h2>
    <p>When you make extra payments on your mortgage, those funds are typically applied directly to the principal balance of your loan. This reduces the amount of money that earns interest, which can save you significant amounts over the life of the loan. For example, if you have a 30-year mortgage at 6.5% interest, making an extra $100 payment each month could potentially save you over $50,000 in interest and pay off your loan years earlier.</p>
    <p>It's important to check with your lender about prepayment penalties or restrictions on extra payments. In the USA, most mortgages allow extra payments without penalties, but some older loans or specific loan types may have limitations. Always confirm your loan terms before implementing a strategy.</p>
    <p>Extra payments can be made in various ways: increasing your regular monthly payment, making bi-weekly payments (which results in one extra payment per year), or applying lump sums from bonuses, tax refunds, or other windfalls. Our calculator helps you model these scenarios to find the approach that best fits your financial situation.</p>
    <p>Remember that while paying off your mortgage early reduces interest costs, it also means you're not earning potential returns elsewhere. Consider your overall financial picture, including emergency savings, retirement accounts, and investment opportunities, before committing to extra payments.</p>
