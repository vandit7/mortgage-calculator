    <h2>Understanding Your Mortgage Payment</h2>
    <p>Your monthly mortgage payment typically includes principal, interest, property taxes, and homeowners insurance (often referred to as PITI). Our calculator provides a complete breakdown of these costs.</p>
    <p>The principal portion goes toward reducing your loan balance, while interest is the cost of borrowing money. Property taxes and insurance are escrowed items that your lender collects monthly.</p>
